Must Read: How to Make a Successful Career in Blockchain? Everything You Need to Know Blockchain vs. Cloud Computing Since we are familiar with both the terms and their features, let us now see the significant differences between them: 1. A cloud is something that we can gain access to through the internet. It is cyberspace where we can access the data online. On the other hand, blockchain is an encrypted system that uses different styles of encryption and hash to store data in protected databases. The system distributes these data records over various nodes and forms a consensus on the position of the data they contain. Data in the form of records are immutable in blockchain, whereas data residing in the cloud are mutable. Blockchain does not provide any service as it is a magnificent technological advancement that is a decentralized, distributed ledger that keeps a record of the provenance of a digital asset. On the other hand, Cloud is a computing service that provides services in three principal formats such as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Blockchain guarantees the prevention of the tempering of data without relying on any third-party trusted centralized authority, whereas the cloud does not assure complete integrity and tamper-free data. Cloud computing can push the execution of blockchain technology-based projects. But it has a centralized (as all the data remains stored in a company’s centralized set of data centers) structure of data fetching. On the other hand, blockchain has a core principle of decentralization, which means it does not store any of its information in one space.
